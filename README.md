The Multi-functional Medical Imaging Intelligent Processing and Analysis System for Precision Orthodontics is a system that relies on medical images in various formats, leverages the computing and storage capabilities of modern computer software, and integrates knowledge and experience in oral orthodontics to diagnose and analyze oral dental issues. As modern society continues to progress, people are placing increasing importance on dental health. Beyond aesthetic considerations, many diseases are linked to oral health. Currently, the prevalence of oral diseases in China exceeds 90%, yet the treatment rate is only 10%, severely impacting the health of the Chinese population. A digital dental medical imaging processing and analysis system can enhance the diagnostic accuracy and work efficiency of orthodontists, effectively elevating the level of orthodontic digitization.

The system is divided into four modules: Data Management, Image Intelligent Algorithm, Visualization, and Data Analysis.

The Data Management Module focuses on data operations. Its functions include standardized storage and management of DICOM medical image formats, support for data migration, backup, and anonymized export operations, and the provision of standardized data operation APIs.

The Image Intelligent Algorithm Module encompasses mainstream medical image segmentation and keypoint detection algorithms. Specifically, it includes automated tooth segmentation algorithms for two-dimensional panoramic radiographs, keypoint detection algorithms for cephalometric radiographs, fusion algorithms for cephalometric radiographs and patient lateral photos based on keypoint matching, and segmentation algorithms for three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) teeth and alveolar bone. This module realizes automatic or semi-automatic segmentation in medical images based on algorithms and supports recommending applicable segmentation algorithms according to image types. For X-ray and CBCT image data, compared to manual segmentation, it supports methods such as region growing, region splitting and merging, and watershed algorithms to achieve rapid segmentation and classification of organs or elements.

The Visualization Module supports the visualization and interactive manipulation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. For two-dimensional images, it supports interactive functions such as marking, measurement, and common image processing operations like brightness, contrast adjustment, and cropping, with persistent storage of markings and image copies. For three-dimensional images, it supports three-view display and three-dimensional rendering, utilizing Ray-Casting direct volume rendering and Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) volume rendering techniques to draw images, supporting various color mappings, preset thresholds, ROIs, and other operations. It also supports spatially interacting and locating the volume-rendered images back to the original images. The results from the Image Intelligent Algorithm Module need to be overlaid onto the original images for visualization and support pixel-level modification of segmentation and classification results. It can use Marching Cubes or other algorithms to achieve three-dimensional mesh reconstruction of CBCT segmentation results.
The Data Analysis Module combines the results from the Image Intelligent Algorithm Module and user markings from the Visualization Module to perform distance or angle measurements. Specifically, it includes common orthodontic measurements such as tooth width, dental arch length, dental arch width, and Spee curve measurements. Based on these measurements, orthodontic analysis and diagnosis are conducted, generating analysis reports that include common cephalometric analysis, tooth crowding evaluation, midline relationship evaluation, and Bolton index analysis. The reports reflect users' markings, measurements, and analysis results on the data.

The project primarily uses technologies such as Qt application development, Python deep learning algorithm design, C++ graphics rendering interaction, and SQL databases.
